How to indentify a container
-----------------------------
There are two ways of identifying a container - Container Name or Container ID.

Container Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each container has a unique name when it's up and running. The name is either specified by the user or allocated by the system automatically.

To list all containers, run command::

  $ docker container ls -a
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                                      NAMES
  1e1a72ca6d42        nginx:latest                   "nginx -g 'daemon of…"   3 days ago          Exited (0) 23 seconds ago                                              wp3-nginx
  e7cea7a2aacf        alphacodinghub/wordpress-fpm   "/entrypoint.sh php-…"   3 days ago          Up 23 minutes               9000/tcp                                   wp3-fpm
  21a1dc2424c5        mariadb:10.5                   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   3 days ago          Up 23 minutes               3306/tcp                                   wp3-db
  1119bb9319c4        redis:5-alpine                 "docker-entrypoint.s…"   3 days ago          Up 23 minutes               6379/tcp                                   wp3-redis

The last column lists the names of containers, while the first column the Container IDs.

Container ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Container ID is a hash ID generated by the system. It looks like a series of random numbers and characters.

We can use the whole Continer ID to identify a container, or use the first-n characters as long as these first-n characters are unique among all containers.

For example, the full ID of the first container in the above list is `1e1a72ca6d42`. We can see that the first two characters `1e` are unique among all containers in the list. So we can use the partial ID `1e` to identify the first container in Docker commands where a Continer ID is required.
e.g. to stop or remove the container `1e1a72ca6d42`::

  $ docker container stop 1e
  1e

  $ docker container rm 1e
  1e
